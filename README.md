# Ad-Bidding-CTR-Prediction-Platform

An end-to-end machine learning and engineering project simulating a real-time ad bidding system. This platform predicts Click-Through Rates (CTR) using ML models, processes ad requests, and provides a live analytics dashboard. 

## Features

ML Model: Logistic Regression or XGBoost pipeline for CTR prediction.

Real-Time API: FastAPI backend serving predictions.

Event Engine: Simulates ad requests, computes bids, logs impressions.

Dashboard: Live Plotly Dash visualization of CTR, win rates, and revenue.

Scalable Architecture: Quickstart mode (SQLite) or Kafka + PostgreSQL for streaming at scale.

A/B Test Ready: Metrics and logging designed for experimentation.

Fully Containerized: Optional Docker deployment for all services.

## Demo / Visuals

CTR by Hour – visualizes click-through performance.

Win Rate – monitors bidding success.

Cumulative Revenue – tracks simulated ad revenue.
